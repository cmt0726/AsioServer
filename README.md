# AsioServer

This project supports a multi-threaded Asynchronous IO server model that can handle an arbitrary number of clients.

While this implementation supports and runs a Chess server, it can be easily changed to support any other kind of client.

To run, open the solution Visual studio and set the Solution startup options to launch both the server and client application. Simply hit run in the IDE and it should launch both the server and the client application.
